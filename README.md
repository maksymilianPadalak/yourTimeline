### About

Some time ago I talked to my friend about the time we met when we were kids. A lot of memories came flooding back. We had a great time talking about music we were listening to when we were ten, youtube videos that we watched together so many times and people we used to hang out with. It made me very nostalgic but also made me come up with and idea for an app. 

I thought it would be great to have some sort of visual representation all my memories with particular people, where I can come every once in a while to bring back "the good old days". Timeline was an obvious choice.

The aim of this project is to make an application for creating timelines, Your Timelines, which you can share with your friends.

### Set up

Download ziped folder.

Open timeline.html in your browser.

Safari desktop version does not support date picker. I'm working to fix it.

### Navigation

Currently Your Timeline has to options:

1. You can create your account, log in and make your own timeline by adding timeline elements. 
2. You can view exemplary timeline with data from external API, that shows NBA games history. It uses HTTP requests and creates timeline elements from JSON data, which will be crucial, when Your Timeline will use databse in the future.

Your Timeline is optimized for desktop and mobile experience. It looks great on every popular smartphone and tablet.

### Technologies

- Java Script
- HTML 5
- CSS 
- Green Sock 

### What did I learn

Developing Your Timeline makes me a better programmer every day. In it's current state this project demonstrates my skills in:
- working with events in Java Script
- working with DOM elements
- creating CSS animations
- using Green Sock
- responsive web design
- user inupts validation
- creating single page web applications
- working with API and JSON data
- creating loading screens
- designing the looks of web applications
- working with Google Chrome developer tools

### Plans for the future

For me Your Timeline is not just a project created to show at a job interview. I work on it every day.

Next steps:
- make every timeline element interactive by adding photos, youtube links and spotify playlists that users associate with particular time of their life
- creating joined timelines with other users
- creating historic timelines for famous figures
