## About

Some time ago I talked to my friend about the time we met when we were kids. A lot of memories cane flooding back. We had a great time talking about music we were listening to when we were ten, youtube videos that we watched together so many times and people we used to hang out with. It made me very nostalgic but also made me come up with and idea for an app. 

I thought it would be great to have some sort of visual database with all my memories with particular people stored, where I can come every once in a while to bring back "the good old days". Timeline was an obvious choice.

The aim of this project is to make an application for creating timelines, Your Timelines, which you can share with your friends.

## Navigation

Currently Your Timeline has to options:

1. You can create your account, log in and make your own timeline by adding timeline elements. 
2. You can view exemplary timeline with data from external API, that shows NBA games history. It uses HTTP requests and creates timeline elements from JSON data, which will be crucial, when Your Timeline will use databse in the future.

### Technologies

- Java Script
- HTML 5
- CSS 
- Green Sock
